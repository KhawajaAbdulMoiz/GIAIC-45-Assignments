// Q 20) Think of something you could store in a array. For example, you could make a list of mountains, rivers, countries, cities, languages, or anything else youâ€™d like. Write a program that creates a list containing these items.


let languages : string[] = [`English`,`Hindi`,`Urdu`,`Tamil`,`Chinese`]
console.log('List of 5 different languages :');
for(let i of languages){
    console.log(i);
    
}
